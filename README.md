# Course Materials: Introduction to Statistics

These are course materials for a class I will teach at the [CAnDA equinox school](https://spw.uni-goettingen.de/stud/school22/) at the University of GÃ¶ttingen in 2022, dealing mainly with an introduction to R and inferential statistics.

The finished website is accessible [here](https://mkthalmann.github.io/intro-stats/).

The material was created using R Markdown.
